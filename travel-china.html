        Despite all this variety there are few things that are generally true across this fascinating country, rich with culture and history. 
        <h2 class="what">What to know about the culture</h2>
        <h3> Examples of rude things to do:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Leave your shoes on when you enter someone's home
        </li>
        <li>Pour yourself tea or water before others at the table </li>
            <li>Take the biggest or best part of a meal or dish for yourself (the host <em><strong> must always </strong></em> offer this to the guest)</li>
            <li>It is an insult to not take seconds when your host has made you a meal (<em>Tip:</em> take small servings, so you have room for multiple servings</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples of polite things to do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Always bring a gift (<em>ideally something from your home city or state or country</em>) when arriving to stay at someone's home for the first time </li>
            <li> Tap the table with the first two fingers of your right hand, next to your cup, when someone pours you tea (<em>Story:</em> The story goes that when the emperor was traveling the country incognito and would serve his staff tea, they would do this to symbolize a "kow-tow", aka a knealing bow, to show him respect) 
        </li>
        
        </ul>
        <h2 class="what">What to travel with on you every day while there</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Your passport</strong>! It is crucial to have this, or a photo copy, of it on you at all times or safely locked away at your hotel.(<strong><em>Tip:</em></strong> Always keep an extra photocopy of your passport in a few places across your bags and items when travelling. This is very helpful if your passport is ever lost or stolen.) </li>
            <li>A symbol card reference kit (<em>allowing you to point to a picture of an item you need like batteries, a hospital, a place to eat, etc.</em>), like this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Point-Travellers-Language-Original-Dictionary/dp/3980880273">one</a>, can be very handy. Here is a an example image: (<em>image outside of Khan Academy server </em>) <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81t-iupUOEL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="image of card with pictures of things one might need when traveling like toothpaste" height="400"> </li>
            <li> Whenever possible, if you don't speak the language, get business cards or show addresses on a phone to get help getting to your destination. </li>
            
        </ol>
        <h2 class="what">Common words to help you get along</h2>
        Many people are intimidated by the idea of speaking a tonal language like Mandarin, if they are native speakers of non-tonal language. Never fear! It isn't as hard to learn as it seems and there are a few key phrases people will understand what you mean, even if you don't get the tones quite right. For example:
        <ul>
            <li>"Xie, Xie": (<em> pronounced <strong> "SHEE EY SHEE EY"</strong></em>) Means thank you (<em>Note:</em> Culturally, Americans say thank you far more often than other cultures, including Chinese culture, generally, however, most know this about Americans and you can say it as much as you need to feel comfortable, but do try to use it sparingly."</li>
            <li>"Bu": (<em>pronounced<strong> "BOO"</strong></em>) Means not or no. It typically goes in front of a verb like "Bu Yao" (<em>meaning</em> don't want), but can be used in a pinch to just say NO, especially if someone is trying to push something on you, like taking you somewhere you don't want to go, selling you something you don't want, etc.</li>
            <li>"Shir":(<em> prounced <strong> "SH-UR"</strong></em>) Means yes or is, depending on the situation and is very useful if someone points to something you want</li>
        </ul>
